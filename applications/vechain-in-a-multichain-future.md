## Title
The Role of Vechain in a Multichain future

## Applicants

Agustin Gomez Beret (only applicant). I am a Lawyer (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina) and Master in Finance (Universidad de San Andres, Argentina). 

I worked as a lawyer for about 5 years before changing my career to Finance. I have been working several years now in Finance. I work as Content Manager and creator. Also I am a portfolio manager.

The first time I heard about bitcoin was in 2016. Since then I have been studying the field. I have been actively working with crypto for the last 2 years at least.

I am currently working as Crypto Business Manager and advisor at Simplestate, a crowdfunding Real Estate company that is evolving into web 3 (leading the transition from web 2 to web 3).

Also, I am the co-host of "Sin Intermediarios", a crypto show on Youtube (in Spanish).

## Summary

This project will consist in a paper where I am to explore in detail the role of Vechain in the future of blockchain. 
I want to analyze different aspects of current blockchains and L2 solutions, and compare them with Vechain, in order to identify where Vechain stands out. 
We are moving into a multichain future, and the idea is to shed light on why Vechain is one of the best solutions to solve real world problems and supply chains.
This will include the analysis of each aspect of the blockchain (mechanism of consensus, scalability, centralization, security, among others).
Also, I want to deep dive in current applications of Vechain in supply chains and real world solutions to see how is helping companies to achieve their goals.
The main thesis of this work is that we are moving into a future where people will use different blockchains for different purposes. And to demonstrate the best fit for Vechain in that future.

### Main field of research

Select the research field out of the 9 fields listed below or state &quot;others&quot;.

5. Empirical studies / real-world measurements / performance analysis &amp; comparison
9. Blockchain applications

### Keywords

Multichain future, tokenization, real world blockchain.

## Research proposal (main body)

### Problem Statement

Almost everyday a new blockchain or L2 solution is born. There is a gap in information where the average web 3 user does not fully understand the differences, benefits and risks of each solution. More important, the average user does not understand what are the best use cases for each blockchain.
As each blockchain has its own design, each has a best fit for some use cases than others.
We are moving into a multichain future (because it is highly unlikely that one blockchain can fit all use cases), where users will use different blockchains for different purposes.
In this context, it is essential that users understand why (and when) they should use one blockchain solution or another.
This project aims to solve this problem, providing a framework for the future and thinking how blockchain solutions can coexist and be used.
In particular to Vechain, I aim to demonstrate that is the best fit for real world applications and supply chains.

### Contributions

This project will contribute to shed light on the current blockchain landscape. 


### Background

The starting point will be whitepapers and on chain data. 
But this project will have also the study of examples to demonstrate how one blockchain can fit some case uses but no others.
To give some context, for example there is a project that aimed to tokenize wine bottles on ethereum, but gas fees where higher thant the cost of the token (i.e. one bottle of wine) and was a failure.
For the analysis of possible real world applications, regulation should be taken into consideration.
Also, broad literature (crypto and economic) should be considered to enrich the analysis.

### Approach

I would divide the project in different parts. First, I would start with a general and theoric approach. Then I would compare different blockchains and take a more focused approach to conclude when a blockchain solution is preferable over another.

Also I would study possible real world problems that blockchain could solve, and some supply chains that could be improved with blockchain. 

Finally, it is important to remark that I aim to use plain language. I have vast experience creating content for non specialist audiences, so I always try to keep this approach. The paper should be easy to read and understand by anyone.

### Risks

As it is a research project risks are minimized, there is not any particular risk expected. 

## Milestones

These are the proposed milestones:

1. Preliminary presentation: a Power Point (or Google Slides) presentation, . This could be done in a webinar, of the draft of the paper for comments.
2. Paper draft for comments.
3. Revised version of paper (subject to further comments).
4. Final version of paper.


## Budget

The budget requested if $30.000. This is because I plan to dedicate about 300 hours for this project. Taking into consideration my background and market.
I propose to split the payment, over the four milestones, according to the following criterion:

1. $15000 at the beginning of the project.
2. $5000 when 1rst paper draft is submitted and approved.
3. $5000 when revised version is submitted.
4. $5000 when final version of paper is approved.

I would be glad if this proposal is taken into consideration. I would be more than happy to collaborate with Vechain project.
